## Projects
### Information Science Master's Thesis: Beyond the Ledger: A Cross-Platform Analysis of Cryptocurrency Dynamics (_2024_)
[Thesis](assets/pdf/MSThesis-WILSON.pdf)

Utilizing advanced statistical methods, including Granger causality tests and correlation matrices, my thesis explores the interconnected dynamics within the cryptocurrency ecosystem across multiple platforms such as Reddit, Discord, and GitHub. The study investigates how these platforms influence cryptocurrency market behaviors and technological development, highlighting the critical role of community interaction in shaping market dynamics. Through a detailed analysis of significant market events like the Ethereum Merge and the FTX collapse, the research examines their impacts on cryptocurrency prices, community engagement, and technological trends. Key findings reveal that platforms like Reddit drive market speculation, Discord supports real-time community interaction, and GitHub mirrors long-term development efforts which differ from social and market trends. The study also highlights the importance of cross-platform dynamics, showing how information flows across these spaces can significantly impact market and development priorities. This thesis contributes to a deeper understanding of the socio-technical interplay within the cryptocurrency market, offering valuable insights for investors, developers, and researchers navigating this volatile and rapidly evolving field.

### Exploratory Text Mining using Machine Learning: Security and Ethical Implications of Blockchain Technology (_2024_)
[Project Website](https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/blockchain-text-mining/home)

This project driven by textual data delves into the security and ethical aspects of blockchain technology, highlighting its applications beyond just cryptocurrencies and its relevance in various industries such as finance, healthcare, and supply chains; the project outlines the divisive nature of blockchain around issues of centralization versus decentralization and discusses the complexity and perceived risks associated with recent market fluctuations. Through textual analysis of public sentiment across platforms like NewsAPI, Reddit, and Medium, the study finds that discussions are generally neutral and often focus on blockchain's financial applications, with varying discourse across platforms: NewsAPI emphasizes broader financial technology, Reddit concentrates on investment themes, and Medium leans towards futurism and academia. The presentation demonstrates the importance of community engagement due to blockchain's open-source nature and concludes that while the overall sentiment towards blockchain is neutral, there is a significant need for greater understanding, adoption, and regulation to navigate its complexities.

### Web Data Science Analysis: Exploring the Correlation Between Cryptocurrency Price Fluctuations and GitHub Commits (_2023_)
[Paper](assets/pdf/WebDataScience-WILSON.pdf)

This research investigates the dynamic relationship between market fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices and the frequency of development activities as recorded by GitHub commits. Employing a methodical data collection process via Yahoo Finance and GitHub API, I meticulously gathered and analyzed a year's worth of cryptocurrency pricing data alongside corresponding GitHub commit logs. This study primarily focused on understanding whether changes in cryptocurrency prices acted as a catalyst or deterrent for developer contributions across various blockchain projects. The research utilized sophisticated statistical methods to probe into these correlations, ultimately revealing a negligible link between the two, as evidenced by an exceptionally low R-squared value. These findings highlight the complex and seemingly independent nature of market forces and developer activity within the decentralized frameworks of cryptocurrency ecosystems, contributing to the broader discourse on how technological and market dynamics interplay in this rapidly evolving field.

### COLUMN Lab Research: Decentralized Markets Versus the PESO Model (_2022_)
[Paper](assets/pdf/GameStopNFTMarketEDA-WILSON.pdf)

This study analyzes the effectiveness of traditional marketing frameworks in decentralized marketplaces, focusing on the now defunct GameStop NFT Marketplace. Utilizing social media mining techniques on platforms like Twitter and Discord, this project assesses the marketing approaches of NFT projects CYBER CREW and MetaBoy, emphasizing the shift from Paid, Earned, Shared, and Owned (PESO) media tactics to a model prioritizing Shared and Owned (SO) media due to the decentralized nature of the market. The research highlights that the traditional PESO model, which prioritizes paid media, does not suit the nuances of decentralized markets where community-driven and directly controlled media have greater impact. The research proposes an adapted SOE model, stressing the significance of shared and owned media in generating consumer interest and driving engagement in a blockchain-based marketplace, aligning better with current consumer behavior and technological interaction in decentralized finance.
